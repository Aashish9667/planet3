          <p>
            A high-fiber diet (fruits, vegetables, whole grains) and increased
            water intake help soften stools and prevent constipation, reducing
            strain during bowel movements.

          <li>Topical Treatments:</li>
          <p>
            Over-the-counter creams, ointments, or suppositories effectively
            relieve itching, pain, and swelling.
          </p>
          <li>Warm Sitz Baths:</li>
          <p>
            Soaking the affected area in warm water multiple times a day
            alleviates discomfort and promotes healing.
          </p>
          <li>Stool Softeners:</li>

          <li>Rubber Band Ligation:</li>
          <p>
            This procedure involves placing a rubber band around the base of the
            hemorrhoid to cut off blood supply, causing it to shrink and fall
            off.
          </p>
          <li>Sclerotherapy:</li>
          <p>
            A chemical solution is injected into the hemorrhoid to shrink it,
            providing relief for less severe cases.
          </p>
          <li>Infrared Coagulation (IRC):</li>
          <p>
            A minimally invasive procedure that uses infrared light to create
            scar tissue, cutting off blood supply to the hemorrhoid and causing
            it to shrink.

            A surgical technique where a circular stapling device is used to
            reposition prolapsed hemorrhoidal tissue and cut off its blood
            supply. It is less painful than conventional surgery and promotes
            quicker recovery.

          Obstructive Defecation Syndrome (ODS) is a condition characterized by
          difficulty in stool passage due to rectal dysfunction. Commonly
          affecting older women, ODS is diagnosed through a defecogram, which
          provides imaging of the rectum during defecation.

          The Stapled Trans-Anal Resection of Rectum (STARR) procedure is an
          effective surgical treatment for ODS. It involves resection of the

            treated internally without leaving a wound, minimizing recovery time
            and eliminating the need for post-operative dressings. This method
            is ideal for select patients.
